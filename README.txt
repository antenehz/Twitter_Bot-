	This project was concentrated on understanding backend development. I used Twitter as a foundation, and used the package 'twit' to easily attain sources. These sources helped me connect to the web server.In order to have the server communicate with a twitter account, a twitter app was created. Once it is created, consumer/access information was obtained for storing purposes (this is found in config.js). In main.js, the project implements two functions. getIt() searches for tweets that contains any combination of characters. postIt() will post comments to an individual's account.

	In order to execute, it is necessary to create an app from Twitter and obtain the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and the access_token_secret of the app. Once that is done, go to terminal, arrive at the path where the project is located, and type the following command: node main.js.
